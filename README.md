# 🤖 AI Blog Generator - The Abomination

*"Because manually writing blog posts is so 2024"*

## 🎭 What is this beautiful disaster?

Welcome to the AI Blog Generator - a web application that combines the power of AI content generation with the most delightfully weird loading animations you've ever seen. It's like having a digital assistant that's part productivity tool, part cartoon character.

### ✨ Features that make this special:

- **🤖 AI Face with Mood Eyes**: Watch as the AI's eyes change color based on what it's doing (green = ready, yellow = thinking, red = oops!)
- **🦷 Animated Teeth Loading Screen**: A 5x5 grid of cartoon teeth that get masked by a bouncing mouth container. Because why not?
- **📝 Smart Content Generation**: Feed it a URL or prompt, and watch the magic happen
- **🔗 WordPress Integration**: Automatically posts your AI-generated content to WordPress
- **🎨 Beautiful UI**: Clean, modern interface that doesn't take itself too seriously

## 🚀 Quick Start

### Prerequisites
- Node.js (because we're not savages)
- Python (for the AI magic)
- A WordPress site (optional, but recommended)

### Installation

1. **Clone this beautiful mess:**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/sciamop/ai-blog-generator.git
   cd "ai-blog-generator"
   ```

2. **Install the Node.js dependencies:**
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

3. **Set up your environment:**
   ```bash
   cp env.example .env
   # Edit .env with your actual values
   ```

4. **Start the Node.js server:**
   ```bash
   node server.js
   ```

5. **Start the Python remote server:**
   ```bash
   python remote-server.py
   ```

6. **Open your browser and go to:**
   ```
   http://localhost:69420
   ```

## 🎮 How to Use

1. **Enter a prompt or URL** in the input field (it's the one that's 50% width and centered, because we're fancy)
2. **Click "Generate Content"** and watch the AI face's eyes turn yellow as it thinks
3. **Marvel at the teeth animation** while you wait (seriously, it's mesmerizing)
4. **Review the generated content** and click "Post to WordPress" if you're happy
5. **Watch the eyes turn green** when everything works perfectly
6. **Cry a little** if the eyes turn red (but don't worry, we've all been there)

## 🏗️ Architecture

This project is a beautiful symphony of:

- **Frontend**: HTML, CSS, JavaScript (with some seriously creative animations)
- **Backend**: Node.js Express server (handles the web interface)
- **AI Engine**: Python Flask server (does the heavy lifting)
- **Database**: WordPress (stores your beautiful content)

## 🎨 The UI Components

### The AI Face
- **Left Eye**: Always watching, always judging
- **Right Eye**: Its partner in crime
- **Status Bar**: The mouthpiece between the eyes (literally)
- **Color Coding**: 
  - 🟢 Green = "I'm ready to help!"
  - 🟡 Yellow = "Thinking... please wait..."
  - 🔴 Red = "Something went wrong, but I'm still cute"

### The Loading Animation
A 5x5 grid of cartoon teeth that get masked by a bouncing mouth container. It's like watching a cartoon character eat, but the teeth never move. Pure genius.

## 🔧 Configuration

IMPORTANT: Create and edit your `.env` file with the following:

```env
# Node.js
PORT=69420
REMOTE_SERVER_URL=http://10.0.0.2:5150

# Authentication
AUTH_USERNAME=admin
AUTH_PASSWORD=your_secure_password
SESSION_SECRET=your_session_secret_here

# WordPress (optional)
WP_URL=https://your-wordpress-site.com
WP_USERNAME=your_username
WP_APP_PASSWORD=your_app_password
```

## 🐛 Known Issues

- The teeth animation might be too mesmerizing and cause productivity loss
- Users might spend more time watching the AI face than actually generating content
- The eyes are so expressive, they might develop their own personality

## 🤝 Contributing

Want to make this even more delightfully weird? Contributions are welcome! Just remember:

1. Keep the animations fun
2. Don't break the teeth
3. The AI face must always have personality
4. More is more when it comes to visual feedback
